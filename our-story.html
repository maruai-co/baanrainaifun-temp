    <!-- Intro narrative -->
    <section>
      <p>The journey of Baanrainaifun began with a small dream — to enjoy safe, healthy food, live a simple life, and escape the chaos. A place where we could be self-reliant in the long run, in a truly sustainable way. From an open plot of land with only a few trees — a rain tree, a lychee tree, and a longan tree — we began planting a forest with our own hands and hearts full of determination. Over the course of ten years, we transformed this space into a little forest hidden within the bustling city of Chiang Mai.</p>

          <p>Baanrainaifun was founded by Khun Noom and Khun Nuch, a couple who share the same dream of living simply, sustainably, and close to nature. Khun Noom was once an engineer in Rayong Province. At the age of 45, he took early retirement to pursue his dream — to plant a forest, grow safe food, and build a life of sustainability. He began planting trees in 2013, and by 2016, he created a small coffee shop that served only healthy drinks and homemade baked goods.</p>
          
          <p>Khun Nuch retired at the age of 48 after working for 21 years as an executive in human resources at a Japanese company in Rayong. In 2016, she followed her heart and joined the journey of Baanrainaifun, running the small café under the lychee trees. Through this, she began living her dream of a simple yet healthy life — inside and out.</p>
          
          <p>Together, they have transformed a once-empty piece of land into a green sanctuary where people can reconnect with nature and experience mindful, healthy living.</p>
